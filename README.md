Topic: The Wolf of Wall Street

In this game, the player plays as a stockbroker. Initially a certain amount of money will be paid to the player's account. 

In the stock market, the player can make decisions to buy or sell stocks. By writing a Multithreaded programme, the 5 stock prices floats in a moderate range. 

Some events will happen to affect the share price to a larger extent. There are logics inside how it affect the price. For example,  a breakthrough of cellphone technology will boost APPLE's price and apparently you should buy it now before it stumbles back. Moreover, you could also buy insider news ti get some "secret information" than others. It all depends on your judgement and how fast you decide~

What's more, you could always check the movement of any stock or your holding of the stock or your liquidity... almost anything. Just follow the tutorial inside the game and wish you could explore much more than what i expect!

How we make use of the aforementioned coding elements to implement our features:


Generally, we aim to provide the player an immense experience by constructing both the sense of time and space whereas…



1.     Random number generator is used to <1> determine the floating of stock price <2> control for the release of different news which affects the stock market.

2.     Multiple 1D arrays and 2D arrays will be used to store sets of incidents/news as well as collections of different commodities to be traded in the market. 

3.     Dynamic memory management will be in need since we will use containers like vectors to store the player’s and the stockmarket's conditions.

4.     Standard I/O will also be important to receive the player’s action and conserve the game status whenever the game is terminated/rebooted.

5.     At last, multiple functions will be put in different files to ensure function reusability.

6.     etc…
